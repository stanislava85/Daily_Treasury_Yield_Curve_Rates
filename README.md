# Daily_Treasury_Yield_Curve_Rates

Each day, The United States Department of Treasury releases Treasury Yield Curve rates. Traders and other market participants need to track this release and be able to understand how it's changed.

In this project I have created a python script that scrapes this data from the Treasury's website and produces a matplotlib chart of the current yield curve.
